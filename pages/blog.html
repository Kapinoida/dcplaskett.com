           while ago, I decided that I should make a change in my life. Until that point, for years I was making a living working in the construction business. It was never something I wanted to do forever, but it paid the bills and I got some enjoyable experience working with my hands. It did teach me the value of demanding work, persistence and most importantly, problem solving. However, for most of my life, I have been quite a nerd and subjects like video games and computers were things that I enjoyed the most.
        </p>
        <p class="white-text text-left blog-margin blog-text">
          In high school, everyone told me to get into computers for the future, turn that love for video games and stuff into something profitable. Being the genius I am, I didn’t. I tried college for a bit, but being 18 or whatever, I felt lost and tired of school. I worked in a grocery store for a couple years, tried school again, with the same result. It wasn’t like I flunked out, I got great grades. I just never learned how to prioritize my time or my mind. Even after years of school, I always looked at schooling and learning and something that was a chore, even though I really enjoyed it.

        <p class="white-text text-left blog-margin blog-text">
          Shortly after the second school stint, I started working in construction. Chicago weather and traffic had gotten the best of me over the years and decided that I should strive for something different. Programming was the new world of construction. Building programs really does take a similar approach as constructing buildings. Planning, allocating time and resources, understanding tools needed, and problem solving are all involved in these processes. I think that is what drew me to looking at this as a future career. I still didn’t know what direction to go from here. Databases, mobile development, game development, web development, ballet dancing.
        </p>
        <p class="white-text text-left blog-margin blog-text">
          So, I did research. What was the best way to go. Java seemed to be the answer. Well, I like Android, so I thought I would try to get into that. I bought books and quickly got lost. Python was also another language that came up often, so I took a stab at it. I got much farther, but still was lost. I found a little course on Ruby on Rails, which seemed interesting. I made it through the course, but again, I was lost. However, this time, web development really struck a chord with me. It was a C sharp (coding joke, what up).
        </p>
        <p class="white-text text-left blog-margin blog-text">
          I looked at some sites to try and learn web development. Codecademy was the site I really started with, but again, I just didn’t seem to collect the information. I mean I could replicate what they said to do, but after that, there wasn’t much of a direction I could go after that. Where does this information go from here? What can I do with the information?
        </p>
        <p class="white-text text-left blog-margin blog-text">
          The problem with these courses wasn’t the material. It wasn’t the money. It wasn’t the ideas. It was how it tried to teach people programming. After a certain point, they just have you keep doing exercises without a way to apply it to something. I ended up finding freeCodeCamp as another alternative to learning web development. 
        </p>
        <p class="white-text text-left blog-margin blog-text">
          When I first started it, I thought it would be more of the same. More of these exercises without application. Except, after sticking to it for a bit, I started to see how it was trying to bring the application part into the fold. This is exactly what I was looking for in a learning experience.

        <p class="white-text text-left blog-margin blog-text">
          Before this happened, I started to also look at schooling. Getting a degree was something I really wanted to do, but again, I didn’t know what I really wanted to get into. Information technology was the obvious filed, but where to go specifically was another question. Sure, programming would be the obvious choice, but I had already tried some of the popular languages and it didn’t stick before. I also love to work on computers, building them from scratch, so I figured this would be a good place to start. As electives, I also did some coursework on web development for my associates, because this was the time I figured that was they direction I would go in programming. 
        </p>
        <p class="white-text text-left blog-margin blog-text">
          I’ll make a small aside here in the University of Phoenix, the college I am attending. I think there can be some stigmata around the school in general, which I can see. They make it very easy for people to get into it, charge them an arm and a leg, and could potentially not be as difficult or challenging. To get accepted, I really didn’t have to prove much. It does cost a lot. The coursework isn’t the most challenging or difficult, depending on the course or instructor. This experience, however, has taught me a lot beyond what degree I will hold after completion. Being fully online, there is no schedule or hand holding to get things done. Each week, you must get things done by the end of it. Before this, I would have trouble scheduling my own time to get things done. I had no skill at self-scheduling, time management, and motivation. I would get easily distracted and would never be able to get anything done in a decent time. Going to this type of college has changed all of that. I can set my own schedule with a decent idea of what I can accomplish within a certain time. This has been insane for me, a skill that has eluded me for quite some time.
        </p>
        <p class="white-text text-left blog-margin blog-text">
          Anyways, the schooling also provided some great barebones programming concepts that helped with the why around programming. Why am I doing these things? What’s the whole point? It wasn’t just to build a website or program. It was to bring functionality to the users. Bring productivity and information for others to use and interact with. Maybe other courses figure we should already know that. Maybe I’m just a big dummy for not knowing that. But it was a fundamental part of the experience that I was missing for some time.
        </p>
        <p class="white-text text-left blog-margin blog-text">
          For my bachelor’s degree, I started working in multimedia development. Essentially, this encompasses many parts of the development process. Creative thinking, the use of creative programs, and coding are all a part of the coursework, which makes it much more interesting that just the coding side of development. I still want to focus on the development part, but being able to see how much of the creative process works can really lead to me being a much more well-rounded programmer. It also makes me much more comfortable in saying that I could potentially be management potential or even start my own development company.

        <p class="white-text text-left blog-margin blog-text">
          After completing the front-end development certificate, as well as with what I am learning in college itself, I have a much higher confidence in my programming journey. I have reached a point where I am actually proud of what I have accomplished. I could never say that about much in my life. That I am proud of my accomplishments. 
        </p>
        <p class="white-text text-left blog-margin blog-text">
          Changing careers is a majorly daunting task. I really don’t know how employers will look at someone like me. I just hope that I can reflect the passion that I feel about web development, learning, and creativity in one way or another. 
        </p>
        <p class="white-text text-left blog-margin blog-text">
          As I make the next steps in my road down the programming path, I know there will be more to learn. There always is. Programming is always evolving, bringing new tools or ideas to the fold. There is nothing I would want more than to be involved with this evolving process, developing latest ideas, modern technologies.
        </p>
        <p class="white-text text-left bottom-margin blog-text">
          If you read this, thank you (what were you thinking?). I really appreciate the time you spend to take in my journey and hopefully it will give some insight into how I feel about web development, programming, and life in general.
